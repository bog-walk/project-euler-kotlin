/**
 * Problem 9: Special Pythagorean Triplet
 * Goal: Given N, with 1 <= N <= 3000, check if there exists any
 * Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = N. Find the max product
 * a*b*c or return -1 if no triplets possible.
 * Note that a Pythagorean triplet is a set of 3 natural numbers
 * such that a < b < c && a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
 * e.g. 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2.
 * Test: 12 -> product = 60 (above 3 * 4 * 50. 4 -> product = -1.
