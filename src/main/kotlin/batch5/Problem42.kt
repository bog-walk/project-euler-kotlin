/**
 * Problem 42: Coded Triangle Numbers
 *
 * https://projecteuler.net/problem=42
 *
 * Goal: Given an integer, if it is a triangle number t_n, return its
 * corresponding term n; otherwise, return -1.
 *
 * Constraints: 1 <= t_n <= 1e18
 *
 * Triangle Number Sequence: The nth term is given by ->
 * t_n = 0.5 * n * (n + 1) ->
 * 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55,...
 *
 * e.g.: N = 2
 *       return -1, as 2 is not a triangle number; however,
 *       N = 3
 *       return 2, as 3 is the 2nd triangle number to exist.
