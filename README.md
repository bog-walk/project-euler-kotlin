# Project Euler __ Kotlin

A Kotlin solution set for the first 100 problems corresponding to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) 
challenges.

90/100 solved: :desert_island: :desert_island: :desert_island: :desert_island: :desert_island: :desert_island:

Some problems have been altered to either generalise their goal or implement further constraints, as influenced by 
the problem outlines found on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges).

## :open_file_folder: Structure Guideline

Inside the **main package**, problem solutions are separated into batches with 10 solution classes per package.

Each problem has a corresponding test class located in the matching batch inside the **test package**.

If a function is used in multiple solutions, it is elevated out of its original class and placed in the 
**util package**. This folder contains custom classes and top-level functions for combinatorics, mathematics, search 
algorithms, string processing, and test automation.
