# Project Euler __ Kotlin
___

A Kotlin solution set for the first 100 problems corresponding to the 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) challenges.

Problem content on the Project Euler site is licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://projecteuler.net/copyright).

Some problems have been altered to either generalise their goal or implement further constraints, as influenced by 
the problem outlines found on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges).

### Structure Guideline

---
Within the **main folder**, problem solutions are separated into batches with 10 solution classes per package. Each 
problem has a corresponding test class located in the matching batch within the **test folder**.

If a function is used in multiple solutions, it is elevated out of its original class and placed in the 
**util folder**. This folder contains custom classes and top-level functions for mathematics, search algorithms, 
string processing, and test automation.

### Sibling Repositories

---
While this is the original solution set, 2 other project repositories have been created to practise the following 
languages:
- [Project Euler __ Python](https://github.com/bog-walk/project-euler-python)
- [Project Euler __ C++]()
